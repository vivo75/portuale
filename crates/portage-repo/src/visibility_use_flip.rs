//! USE-flip suggestions for autounmask.

use crate::*;

/// The parent-side `--autounmask-use` mechanism: unlike
/// `suggested_use_candidate` (which flips the candidate's flag), this
/// flips the requesting parent's flag for atoms whose use-dep was
/// originally conditional on the parent's USE (already evaluated away by
/// `enqueue_flat_deps`): would the re-evaluated atom resolve under the
/// flip?
///
/// Only parent-active violated conditionals count ([`violated_parent_flags`]).
/// Gated on: valid parent IUSE, no mask/force pin, satisfiable under the
/// flip, and no new REQUIRED_USE violation (an old one doesn't disqualify).
/// First viable candidate in descending version order wins.
/// Portage: lib/_emerge/depgraph.py, _show_unsatisfied_dep
///
/// Attached to the dependency's own `GraphEntry` (`parent_use_suggestion`)
/// rather than the parent's entry (no per-parent reasons list exists).
/// `(parent_category, parent_package, parent_version, [(flag, desired)])`.
