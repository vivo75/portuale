// Portuale: a multicall-style binary, busybox-style: one static binary
// behaves as `emerge`, `ebuild`, `mrg`, `vdb` or `portageq` depending on
// argv[0] (a symlink beside it) or an explicit first argument. `emerge`
// resolves and merges packages, `ebuild` runs phase chains and the
// merge/unmerge/package steps; both recognize their whole Portage CLI
// surface by name even where a flag is not implemented. `portuale --help`
// lists the applets.
