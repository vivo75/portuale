# Porting pilot

This started as the "Suggested first execution step" pilot from
[`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md): a small, complete run of the whole pipeline (Rust
port, Python harness, shared black-box contract suite, multicall dispatch
skeleton) on the smallest meaningful slice. It has since grown one slice
further into depgraph/config-resolution territory: atom matching, the
foundational building block both of those subsystems are built on.

## Layout

```
PORTING/
  PROMPT.md                    planning prompt this pilot implements
  rust/                        Rust workspace
    portage-versions/          shared lib: port of lib/portage/versions.py (vercmp, ververify)
    versions-harness/          CLI harness over portage-versions
    atom-harness/               port of a v1 subset of lib/portage/dep.py's
                                 Atom + match_from_list (see atom.rs's doc comment)
    multicall/                 emerge/ebuild dispatch skeleton (dry-run stub only)
  python/
    versions_harness.py        thin CLI wrapper around the real portage.versions

    extract_snapshot.py          (re-)generates gentoo_snapshot.json from a live tree

                                 speedup, checks/updates baseline.json
    baseline.json                recorded speedup from the last --update-baseline run

## What this proves

- **`versions-harness`**: a faithful Rust port of `vercmp`/`ververify`,
  checked against the real Python implementation through a neutral CLI
  contract (not a product CLI, not FFI/PyO3 bindings) -- see `PROMPT.md`
  hard goal 4 and the "black-box via CLI/API" decision.
- **`multicall`**: proves the `argv[0]`-based dispatch mechanism for
  shipping `emerge`+`ebuild` as one static binary (`PROMPT.md`,
  "emerge/ebuild binary shape"). Behavior is a dry-run stub only, per the
  first-port scope decision -- no dependency resolution or phase execution
  yet.
- **`atom-harness`**: the depgraph/config-resolution follow-up work's first
  slice -- both of those subsystems are built on atom parsing and matching
  a dependency atom against candidate package versions, so it's the
  natural next layer above `versions-harness` (which it depends on for
  `vercmp`). Deliberately scoped to a documented v1 grammar subset (no USE
  deps, wildcards, build-ids, repo constraints, or slot operators -- see
  the doc comment at the top of `rust/atom-harness/src/atom.rs`); the
  Python harness explicitly rejects anything outside that subset as
  `INVALID` so both sides agree on the same input language. Includes a
  faithful port of an easy-to-miss PMS rule: a bare atom whose package name
  is followed by something version-shaped (`foo-bar-2`) is rejected as
  ambiguous, not silently accepted.
- **`PORTING/tests`**: an example of the jointly-owned contract suite
  described in `PROMPT.md` under "Ownership" -- it imports nothing from
  either implementation, driving both purely as subprocesses, so it stays
  valid regardless of how either side's internals evolve.
- **`PORTING/bench`**: the performance-regression gate from `PROMPT.md`
  hard goal 2 ("Rust must be measurably faster... tracked over time in CI
  as a regression gate"). `run_benchmark.py` feeds an identical batch of
  operations to both harnesses' `batch` subcommand (many ops per process,
  so process-spawn overhead doesn't drown out the comparison), takes the
  best of several timed repetitions per side, and refuses to report numbers
  at all if the two implementations' outputs disagree. It exits nonzero if
  Rust isn't at least `--min-speedup` times faster than Python, and
  (`--check-baseline`) if speedup regresses more than 10% below the
  recorded `baseline.json`. Workload defaults to `gentoo_snapshot.json` --
  real package/version pairs from a real Gentoo tree, mostly comparing two
  versions of the *same* package (the realistic vercmp usage pattern) --
  per PROMPT.md's "real, vendored Gentoo tree snapshot" decision; pass
  `--dataset synthetic` to use seeded-random version strings instead. As of
  the last `--update-baseline` run, Rust is **~6x faster** than Python on
  the real snapshot.
- **`PORTING/musl`**: the minimal-Linux gate from `PROMPT.md` hard goal 3
  and "Test/benchmark harness architecture" ("Rust CI also gates on a musl
  static build smoke-tested inside a minimal (scratch/busybox-level)
  container"). `Containerfile` cross-builds both binaries against musl
  (Alpine's own `rust`/`cargo` packages target musl natively, so no
  rustup/target-add is needed) with `relocation-model=static` forced via
  `rust/.cargo/config.toml` -- the resulting binaries have no dynamic
  section at all, not even a reference to musl's own dynamic loader
  (verified with `ldd`/`readelf`). The runtime stage is `FROM scratch`:
  no libc, no shell, no busybox, nothing but the three binaries.
  `smoke_test.sh` builds that image and exercises `versions-harness`,
  `atom-harness`, `emerge`-dispatch, `ebuild`-dispatch, and batch mode
  inside it, exiting nonzero on any failure.

Known simplification: `versions-harness`/`portage-versions` compare
version components as `i128` rather than Python's arbitrary-precision
integers. See the comment at the top of
`rust/portage-versions/src/lib.rs`.

Known scope cut: `atom-harness` ports a documented v1 subset of the real
atom grammar (see above and the doc comment in
`rust/atom-harness/src/atom.rs`) -- USE deps, wildcards, build-ids, repo
constraints, slot operators, and EAPI parametrization are all deferred.
Candidates for matching are plain `category/package-version[-rN][:slot[/subslot]]`
strings rather than full Package objects (no package-db/depgraph model
exists yet in this pilot), which mirrors a fallback path the real
`match_from_list` already supports.

`gentoo_snapshot.json` was extracted from a full local Gentoo tree
checkout (`/.gentoo/repos/gentoo` on the machine this was vendored on) with
`extract_snapshot.py`, using the real `portage.versions.pkgsplit` as the
authority for parsing "pn-pv" ebuild filenames into package/version pairs
-- not a hand-rolled parser. To refresh it against a newer tree:

```sh
python3 PORTING/bench/extract_snapshot.py /path/to/a/gentoo/tree
```

## Running it

Build both Rust binaries:

```sh
cd PORTING/rust && cargo build --release
```

Try the harnesses directly:

```sh
# Python
python3 PORTING/python/versions_harness.py vercmp 1.0-r1 1.0

# Rust
PORTING/rust/target/release/versions-harness vercmp 1.0-r1 1.0

# batch mode (benchmark-oriented: many ops, one process)
printf 'vercmp 1.0 1.0\nververify 1.0_pre2\n' | PORTING/rust/target/release/versions-harness batch
```

Try the atom-matching harness:

```sh
# Python
python3 PORTING/python/atom_harness.py parse ">=dev-libs/foo-1.2.3-r1:2"

# Rust
PORTING/rust/target/release/atom-harness parse ">=dev-libs/foo-1.2.3-r1:2"

# match_from_list-equivalent: prints the matching candidates, comma-joined
PORTING/rust/target/release/atom-harness match ">=dev-libs/foo-1.2.3" \
    dev-libs/foo-1.0 dev-libs/foo-2.0
```

Try the multicall skeleton:

```sh
ln -s PORTING/rust/target/release/multicall /tmp/emerge
/tmp/emerge --pretend sys-apps/foo
```

Run the contract suite (builds the Rust binaries itself; requires `cargo`
on `PATH`):

```sh
python3 -m pytest PORTING/tests -v
```

Run the benchmark / regression gate:

```sh
# report speedup, no gating (uses the vendored real Gentoo tree snapshot)
python3 PORTING/bench/run_benchmark.py --ops 200000

# fall back to synthetic seeded-random version strings instead
python3 PORTING/bench/run_benchmark.py --ops 200000 --dataset synthetic

# CI-style: fail if speedup regressed vs. the recorded baseline
python3 PORTING/bench/run_benchmark.py --check-baseline

# record a new baseline after an intentional, reviewed perf change
python3 PORTING/bench/run_benchmark.py --update-baseline

# same gate, wrapped as a pytest for CI (skipped by default -- see
# PORTING/tests/test_benchmark_gate.py)
PORTING_RUN_BENCHMARK=1 python3 -m pytest PORTING/tests/test_benchmark_gate.py -v
```

Run the musl static-build smoke test (requires `podman` or `docker`; builds
a container image, so it needs network access for the Alpine base layer
and `apk add rust cargo` the first time):

```sh
bash PORTING/musl/smoke_test.sh

# same gate, wrapped as a pytest for CI (skipped by default -- see
# PORTING/tests/test_musl_smoke.py)
PORTING_RUN_MUSL_SMOKE=1 python3 -m pytest PORTING/tests/test_musl_smoke.py -v -s
```
